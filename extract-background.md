# Extract Background from ChadEmpire Project

To get the background from your ChadEmpire project, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Clone and Examine
```bash
# Clone your ChadEmpire repository
git clone https://github.com/linkln33/ChadEmpire.git
cd ChadEmpire

# Look for background-related files
find . -name "*.html" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.js" | grep -i background
```

## Option 2: Manual Copy
1. Go to your ChadEmpire repository on GitHub
2. Look for files containing the animated background
3. Copy the relevant code and paste it here

## Common Background Files to Check:
- `index.html` - Look for canvas elements or background divs
- `style.css` - Look for animation keyframes and background styles
- `script.js` or similar - Look for particle system code
- `package.json` - Check for animation libraries

## What to Look For:
- Canvas elements with particle animations
- CSS animations with keyframes
- JavaScript libraries like Three.js, p5.js, or particles.js
- Background-related CSS classes
- Animation libraries in package.json

Once you provide the background code, I can integrate it into your current project!
